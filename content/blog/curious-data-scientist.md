## What's the Problem this post is solving?
NBC Universal hired my company, emdata, to help build out a data science team to solve really interesting problems for their Digital Marketing division. This division spent ample resources to build world class data science capabilities: they hired a team of talented data engineers, data scientists, and visualizations engineers that worked together to acquire, store, model, and visualize answers to these interesting problems.

They also invested in multiple data platforms, bought the latest visualization tools, and had clear expectations on the specific problems that needed to be solved with data. 

But the returns to that investment were lower than expected. What's more, the results of the models didn't seem to 

While the Digital Marketing division at NBC Universal did everything they were supposed to do when building a data science team, there was clearly something missing. It took far too long to produce results. The problems that these models sought to answer were no longer interesting.

What went wrong? Honestly, I really didn't know. It hadn't occured to me that there was anything missing. That is, until now.

## Why You Need a Team of Curious Data Scientists
In a [November 2018 article in the Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org/2018/11/curiosity-driven-data-science), Eric Colson, [Chief Algorithms Officer at Stitch Fix](https://www.stitchfix.com/about), shares how Stitch Fix thinks about how data scientists should explore and produce results. Instead of a rigid focus on what specific problems needs to solve, they should be empowered to create novel solutions to problems no one even thinks of. He says, "none of [Stitch Fix's new] capabilities were asked for by executives, product managers, or domain experts — and not even by a data science manager (and certainly not by me). Instead, they were born out of curiosity and extracurricular tinkering by data scientists."

According to Eric, one of the reasons creative exploration occurs so frequently at Stitch Fix is because they've enabled this exploration at a low cost. And the key to making this happen, he says, is to hire "full-stack data scientists" and provide them a data platform that abstracts away many of the technical particulars of computational processing that bedevil even the most talented data scientists. I'd like to break down what a "full-stack data scientist" looks like and what tools she uses that 

AutoML
data acquisition, data exploration, feature engineering, model selection, experimentation and prediction.

It is going to enable business analysts and developers to evolve machine learning models that can address complex scenarios.

There are multiple teams that get involved in arriving at the solution. Data engineering team works on data acquisition and preparation. Data scientists focus on experimentation and optimization of models. DevOps teams own the development environment, tooling, and hosting the inference models in production.


What technical resources does the data scientist need to be autonomous?
Cloud resources to scale up, down and sideways
  - AWS & Sagemaker
  - H20
  - Azure Machine Learning Studio
  

Instead, leverage “full-stack data scientists” with the skills to do all the functions. This lowers the cost of trying things, as a single tinkering initiative may require each of the data science functions I mentioned. Of course, data scientists can’t be experts in everything. So, you’ll need to provide a data platform that can help abstract them from the intricacies of distributed processing, auto-scaling, etc. This way the data scientist focuses more on driving business value through testing and learning, and less on technology.
